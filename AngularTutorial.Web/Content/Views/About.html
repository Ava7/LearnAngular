        <h1>Hi there,</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            Thanks for stopping by! I don't know about you, but I learn best by <em>doing</em>. I wrote this site to try
            to make it easier for people like me to learn AngularJS, which can be daunting to learn if you're just getting
            started. If you have any comments on the site, good or bad, please let me know by way of the feedback page.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical details</h2>
        <p>
            If you are interested in how this site works, you'll be happy to know that all the code is
            <a href="https://github.com/LeviBotelho/angular-tutorial" target="_blank"> freely available on GitHub and licensed under
                the GPL-3</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a brief overview, the backend runs on <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC</a> and all of the
            backend code is done in C#. The frontend is coded in <a href="http://www.angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a>
            (of course!) with the CSS being handled by <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> with the Yeti
            theme from <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a> and icons from
            <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>. Oh, and those lovely code editors
            are from Mozilla's outstanding <a href="http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about" target="_blank">Ace</a> project, hooked in with some
            help from <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/" target="_blank">AngularUI</a>. At some point I'll write a more in-depth
            summary of how this site is built on <a href="http://www.levibotelho.com" target="_blank">my blog</a> and post a link here.
        </p>
        <h2>It's a legal matter, baby</h2>
        <p>
            Just to be clear, I am in no way affiliated with Google or the AngularJS team, unfortunately ;).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Happy learning!</p>
